{"name":"Mx","tagline":"A scriptable mixer, data patching matrix and timeline for SuperCollider","body":"\r\nMx\r\n========\r\n\r\nMx is a patching system for SuperCollider.  It uses an adapter/driver system where object descriptions can be written that specify the inlets and outlets of an object, how it can be connected to, stopped, started and any extra features like guis, timeline aware guis, relocating.\r\n\r\nThis allows objects of many different types to connect and interact with each other without needing to participate in a common API.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\nMatrix patchbay gui with draggable cables, drawer, large library of Instr functions.\r\nTimeline view - supports Splines and Soundfiles so far\r\nMixer - basic solid mixer with scope, meters\r\nScripting API\r\nConnect objects with code while you hear and see the results on the gui\r\nMxQuery for filtering objects and iolets and patching, copying, moving in bulk\r\n\r\nSupported objects so far\r\n========================\r\n\r\nBus - jack anything into the mixer\r\nDocument - run any code\r\nInstr - patch anything through a large library of instr\r\nSplineFr (frame rate splines)\r\nMultiSplineFr (multi dim splines)\r\nSFP - sound file player [ note that your preferred sound file player can be adapted to work here too]\r\nCCResponder\r\nCCBank - bank of cc\r\nNoteOnBank - bank of midi notes\r\nSliders\r\n\r\n... more to come\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-154147-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
